// This algorithm is not in use! We left it here for consideration later.
// I'm not 100% sure of this, but we think the algorithmic approach to placing room furniture could
//  just be boiled down to different rule sets with various knobs.
// For example, "generate room - midwest farmhouse" might place more
//  shelving along the walls for knick-knacks (rules), add lots of types of chairs everywhere (rules),
//  dial up the density of objects (knob), and place plastic on the furniture (joke) :)
